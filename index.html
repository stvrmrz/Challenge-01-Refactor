    <!--The <header> element introduces the first pieces of content on the webpage. The "Horiseon" company logo is special in that it spans two 
    classes. The Span element is useful here since we're targeting the specific characters "seo" for unique styling in the stylesheet. The nav 
    element has a class attribute and containing an unordered list of three key subject areas for the main page. Each subject area in the nav 
    has a hypertext anchor. When the user clicks on any of these subject areas on the nav, then the user is directly taken to that specific part 
    of the page.-->
